Title

Network Vulnerability Scanning Report

Objective

To identify open ports, services, and potential security risks in a local network using Nmap.

Tool Used

Nmap

Scanning Scope

Local network devices

Methodology

Performed network scan to discover active hosts

Identified open and closed ports

Detected running services

Observed OS information

Analyzed potential security risks

Observations

Multiple devices detected on the local network

Common ports such as 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were open

Services like web servers were identified

Risk Analysis

Open ports increase the attack surface

Exposed services can be targeted if not secured

Proper firewall and access controls are required

Conclusion

Network vulnerability scanning helps identify exposed services and improves overall network security awareness.
